3.2 Best Routing Option
A company that deals in energy management, automation solutions, spanning
hardware, software, and services wanted to reduce the costs involved in their existing
supply chain flows for 240 manufacturing facilities around the world and 110
distribution centers and analyze potential opportunities to assimilate new business
units that they had just acquired. The firm built a supply chain predictive model that
could automatically create the best routing options for enormous raw materials supply
chain which includes circuit breakers that are small enough to fit on a store shelf to
transformers that are the size of a large room. They used Machine Learning models to
feed data of enterprise supply chain data such as transportation rates and policies, data
regarding product shipping routes etc. from several business units. Data engineers at
first built a data extraction tool that could collect the enterprise data from all the ERP
systems, verify and ‘clean’ the data. The customized model analyzed 200,000
transportation policy data points, 130,000 flow and routing constraints, and more than
150 initial scenarios and could identify $9.32 million (8 million Euros) in annual
savings which could potentially be obtained by altering product flow in the supply
chain.

In spend analytics, the
system will be able to cross-check every single invoice that’s entered, rapidly flag-up
any errors or inconsistencies, and immediately alert the appropriate persons on both
sides of the order, where it would usually take days if processed manually
